# Student lab answer key

## Microsoft 365 user interface

Given the dynamic nature of Microsoft cloud tools, you may experience user interface (UI) changes that were made following the development of this training content. This will manifest itself in UI changes that do not match up with the detailed instructions presented in this lab manual.

The Microsoft World-Wide Learning team will update this training course as soon as any such changes are brought to our attention. However, given the dynamic nature of cloud updates, you may run into UI changes before this training content is updated. If this occurs, you will have to adapt to the changes and work through them in the lab exercises as needed.
